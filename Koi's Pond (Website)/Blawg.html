    <h1>The Self indulgent Blawg </h1>
    <p>This is basically the the part where I talk about something to fill out some pages and stuff. 
        To do this we're going to explain how in fact I like ponds. 
    </p>

    <p> The pond is just a scenic ideal place to do anything. preferably there's a little waterflow so it isn't stagnant. Add in some fish and a couple froggers. 
        A good tiled or concrete slab with a wooden park bench so you can marvel at the pond and do whatever activity you like.
        Hilly but flat enough for me to have a picnic without stuff rolling away. You just basically want a slight slope with thick enough grass that things just stop.
    </p>
    <p> plenty of fish so i can look at and draw them. Cat fish are neat but koi would also work.</p>
