    <p>Welcome! <a href="https://www.myretrotvs.com/"> Watch some TV</a>.</p>

<p> Here's some things I like:<ul>
  <li>Video Games </li>
  <li>
  <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Pixel Art</a></li>
  <li>Retro & Antique's of all kinds</li>
</ul>

<p>I myself am a lover of everything that's leftover from previous decades. I use a typewriter when I can for writing things for myself, enjoy older forms of creating art like printmaking, and especially the gems and quirks of old technology. 

<p>My Typewriter is a Olivetti Underwood model __ in stunning Teal I inherited from my grandmother. (since she didn't want it anymore. she's still alive)
It's sat in pretty much mint condition for the better part of the last 4 decades.  </p>

<p>Another thing I collect is postcards, They've got to be my favourite kind of souvenir to get while travelling. Typically inexpensive and artistic they're great display pieces. </p>

<p>I grew up on antiquated technology so I've played a ton of titles across gaming history. From the classic "Medal of Honour" series on the PlayStation 1 & 2, Atari and Arcade classic collections with Gauntlet and Rampage being a favourite, to Halo: Reach on the Xbox 360 as well as the early call of duties, and practically every Wii game that could be played by a kid. </p>

<p>This is just my little slice of the internet and I'll shove some more of my interests in it when I feel like it.
