# Koi-s-Pond
This is going to be the place where i build my personal website.
Going to store some bad grammar, Photos, my art, and other garbage i've polished up for you to see.
don't expect too much from me i've never done serious coding up until this point.
0-0 ^3 going to give it my best shot.

I'll try to make my set a bit more retro looking and keep to the theme of being the pond for my koi fish and ideas where i can relax.
